In this project, I learned about Redux, side effects, and asynchronous code. I learned the different places where you can put asynchronous code and side effects, such as in components or action creators.

Pointer 1: You should prefer reducers for data transformations and only put side-effects or async code into your components or action creators.

Redux DevTools is a great tool that allows us to understand our Redux store and state. We can use it to time travel and gain deep insights into Redux.

This redux-sample app also contains a backend where the cart items are stored in Firebase. You can check out how to apply that to your future projects.

Pointer 2: To use the Firebase backend, you will need to create a Firebase project and obtain a URL for your Realtime Database. You can then replace the URL in the project with your own.
